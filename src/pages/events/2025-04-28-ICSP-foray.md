We’ll explore the park’s rich woodland trails in search of spring fungi—morels, cup fungi, and other seasonal treasures. Whether you're an experienced mushroom hunter or just getting started, this is a great way to learn, connect, and enjoy a beautiful spring day with fellow mycophiles. 

📍 Meeting Location: Parking area just inside the entrance to the park.

🕚 Start Time: 11:00 AM

⏳ Duration: Approximately 2-3 hours

🧺 What to Bring: A basket or mesh bag, knife, field guide (optional), water, snacks, and weather-appropriate clothing.

🔎 Mushroom ID Session
After our walk, we’ll gather to lay out and examine our finds together. It’s a great chance to share discoveries, ask questions, and work together to identify what we've collected—with help from experienced members.

🍽️ Morel Tasting (If Found!)
If we're lucky enough to come across some morels, we’ll do a light tasting session afterward so everyone can try a bite of these prized spring delicacies. We’ll bring a camp stove and cook them up on-site (properly cleaned and cooked, of course!).

🎞️ Photo Contest!
While you're out foraging, snap some great photos! We're holding a Spring Foray Photo Contest—submit your best mushroom shots from the event for a chance to be featured on our website and social media.

🪙 Note: Nebraska State Park entry fees apply. This event is open to members and any guests they'd like to bring along!

See you in the woods!
