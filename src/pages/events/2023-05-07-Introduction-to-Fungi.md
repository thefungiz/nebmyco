title: An Introduction to Fungi - Lauritzen Gardens
date: 2023-05-07
description: This class will include a 30-minute talk providing a brief overview of the fungal kingdom, ethical foraging practices, and methods/patterns of identification. Additionally, there will be a 1-hour foray through Lauritzen Gardens' woodland trail to search for mushrooms and apply any identification methods learned during the talk. Participants will be shown how to use the Inaturalist app to help them identify organisms. As a pre-requisite, downloading and logging into the free Inaturalist phone app is encouraged, as it will greatly help with identification for most fungi. (hosted by Lauritzen Gardens)
