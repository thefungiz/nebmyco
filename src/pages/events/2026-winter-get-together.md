🗓 Sunday, February 22
🕕 6:00–9:00 PM (come late or leave early if you like)

### 📍 Mahoney State Park – Peter Kiewit Lodge, Red Oak Room

This is meant to be a relaxed “warming-up” event before the fungi season really kicks off in March and April—more social than structured, with plenty of time to chat, eat, and swap stories.

### 🍲 Potluck (with mushrooms!)

Please bring a dish to share if you can. We encourage using mushrooms somewhere in your dish—fresh, dried, powdered, cultivated, or store-bought all count.
If you use wild mushrooms, please label them clearly.
If you plan to bring a dish, please add your name and dish to this sheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xd_dN9epSV0kaDJ29pmFgVZqukJCiUOETjNYb2kWgJ8/edit?usp=sharing 

### 🎁 Fungi-Themed White Elephant

We’ll have a white elephant gift exchange later in the evening.

Gifts should be fungi-related (broadly interpreted!)
Please aim to keep gifts $25 or under
Fungi-adjacent items like books, art, field gear, or quirky mushroom finds are all welcome.

### ☕ Warm Drinks
We’ll have a warm drink station (coffee, tea, cider, etc.). Feel free to bring a thermos or something fun to share.

### 🍄 Casual, Optional Activities

Nothing formal—join in if it sounds fun, skip it if not:

* Show & Tell Table – photos, books, art, dried specimens, cultivation projects, or anything fungi-related
* Photo Loop – member-submitted mushroom photos running in the background. If you have any photos you’d like to include, please send a reply email with those images!
* “What Are You Excited For This Season?” Board – jot down species, skills, or goals for 2025

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Kids Welcome

Children are welcome to attend with their adults. We’ll have a few low-key, kid-friendly activities available.

### 🚗 Important Park Info

Every vehicle entering Mahoney State Park must have a valid Nebraska State Park Permit.
Only registered service animals are allowed in the building.

If you plan to come, great—and if you can’t, we hope to see you at a foray soon. This is a low-pressure, come-as-you-are kind of night.
