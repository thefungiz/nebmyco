Main meal catered by Open Harvest, please bring a side dish or dessert to share. BYOB.

**W﻿hite Elephant Gift Exchange**: please bring a wrapped myco-themed gift (value of $20 or less), unlabeled. White Elephant gift exchange works like this: the first person chooses a gift and unwraps it, the second person decides to either chose an unwrapped gift or to "steal" the previous gift, so on until all the gifts are unwrapped. A gift can only be "stolen" twice. The first person will get the final choice of any gift still in "play". 

T﻿here may be other activities, depending on attendance, but there will be ample time to talk about fungi and connect or re-connect with lovely mushroom people!
