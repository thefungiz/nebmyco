title: Dyeing Natural Fibers with Lobster Mushrooms
date: 2023-05-07
description: Denise Wally and Rebecca Chandler will teach participants how to use lobster mushrooms (plus examples of a few others) to dye wool yarn and silk fabric. We use mordant to make the dyes deeper and colorfast. We will also alter the pH to get a different color palette.

**Registration is required for this workshop.** This must be a limited class, with a max of 12 people. 
We will be working with hot liquids and mild chemicals, so any personal protective equipment (PPE) you have would be a bonus. If you wish to dye a small personal item, please bring it, animal fibers will dye the best (wool or silk). A $20 class fee will cover fiber, dye materials, rubber gloves, chemicals, and a fun sticker. Some PPE will be provided, and some will be available to use for the workshop.
