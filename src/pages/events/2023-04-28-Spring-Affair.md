Spring Affair will be held in Pavilion 4 at the Lancaster Event Center. With more than 4,000 attendees each year, Spring Affair is a great place to get our organization's name in front of lots of people! Nebmyco will have a table and volunteers to help spread the spores of fun-gi's and fun-gal's in Nebraska.
