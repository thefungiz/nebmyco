title: About the Nebraska Mycological Society
---
### Mission

We are a mushroom club based out of Eastern Nebraska that is dedicated to the education, identification, and foraging of wild mushrooms. We are made up of fungi enthusiasts who share information about mushrooms through online forums, forays, classes and meetings. Join us at our next meeting or contact us to learn more! 

### Vision

Right now we are starting out, but we hope to be a reputable society someday. We have goals to eventually become a non-profit organization recognised by the North American Mycological Association.

### History

Started in December of 2020 by our co-founders Derek Zeller and Rebecca Chandler to bring together the fungi masters within the great state of Nebraska.
