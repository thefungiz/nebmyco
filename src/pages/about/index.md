### Mission & Vision

At the Nebraska Mycological Society, our mission is to promote education, conservation, and appreciation of fungi in Nebraska and beyond. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and proud member of the North American Mycological Association (NAMA), we are dedicated to advancing the scientific understanding of mushrooms and other fungi, while also fostering a sense of community among those who share our passion.

Through educational programs, field trips, and other outreach efforts, we aim to increase awareness of the ecological importance of fungi and their role in human culture. We strive to inspire our members and the public to explore the diversity and beauty of the fungal world, while also encouraging responsible and sustainable practices in the collection, cultivation, and study of mushrooms.

Our commitment to education and conservation is grounded in a spirit of curiosity, respect, and stewardship. We believe that by sharing our knowledge and love of fungi, we can enrich the lives of our members, our communities, and the natural world.

### History

The Nebraska Mycological Society was incepted in December of 2020 during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. We started online through Discord, Facebook, and other social media and meetups via Zoom. Spring of 2021 was our first foray at Indian Cave State Park. It was a fantastic event and each person attending brought home a pound of morels! We met up at other parks throughout the mushroom season, including Lake Zorinsky, Hummel Park, Wilderness Park, and Mormon Island State Recreation Area. In the summer of 2021, we incorporated as a non-profit scientific organization to better serve our members and community with monthly presentations/workshops, quarterly publications (The Spore), and seasonal forays.
