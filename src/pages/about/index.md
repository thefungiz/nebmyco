### Mission & Vision

We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit based out of Nebraska that is dedicated to the education, identification, and foraging of wild mushrooms. We are made up of fungi enthusiasts who share information about mushrooms through online forums, forays, classes, and meetings. We are affiliated with the North American Mycological Association (NAMA). Join us at our next meeting or contact us to learn more!

### History

The Nebraska Mycological Society was incepted in December of 2020 during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. We started online through Discord, Facebook, and other social media and meetups via Zoom. Spring of 2021 was our first foray at Indian Cave State Park. It was a fantastic event and each person attending brought home a pound of morels! We met up at other parks throughout the mushroom season, including Lake Zorinsky, Hummel Park, Wilderness Park, and Mormon Island State Recreation Area. In the summer of 2021, we incorporated as a non-profit scientific organization to better serve our members and community with monthly presentations/workshops, quarterly publications (The Spore), and seasonal forays.
