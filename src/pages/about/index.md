### Mission

We are a 501c3 non-profit based out of Nebraska that is dedicated to the education, identification, and foraging of wild mushrooms. We are made up of fungi enthusiasts who share information about mushrooms through online forums, forays, classes, and meetings. Join us at our next meeting or contact us to learn more!

### Vision

Right now we are starting out, but we hope to be a reputable society someday. We have goals to eventually become recognized by the North American Mycological Association.

### History

Started in December of 2020 to bring together the fungi masters within the great state of Nebraska.
